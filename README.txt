I am currently (January 2024) progressing through the Full-Stack Engineering program on Codecademy.com therefore this site will include project in a variety of languages and styes.

I am using this site/repository as a place to put all my Codecademy off-platform project, my practice projects, and my portfolio project.

Unless noted otherwise projects are being given by Codecademy.com.

Excursion Project:
    Off-platform Git/GutHub project from Codecademy.  Was given the following directions  and resources https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/f1-excursion
